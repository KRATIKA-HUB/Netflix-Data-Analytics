## 🧾 About the Project:

The Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard is a data visualization and analytics project built using Power BI to uncover insights from Netflix’s vast library of movies and TV shows.

The main goal of this project is to transform raw data into visually compelling insights that help understand content performance, audience preferences, and regional trends. By analyzing average ratings, number of votes, and genre popularity across countries, this dashboard enables a deep understanding of what makes certain content successful on Netflix.

Through this project, I explored end-to-end data analysis — from data cleaning and modeling to interactive dashboard design — demonstrating how data storytelling can support strategic decision-making in the entertainment industry.

### This project reflects my ability to:

Perform data-driven exploration using Power BI

Build dynamic dashboards with KPIs and filters

Apply analytical thinking to derive actionable insights

Design aesthetic and intuitive visual layouts for better user experience

The dashboard uses a black-and-red Netflix-inspired theme to maintain brand consistency and a professional look. It includes genre-based comparisons, regional content maps, and detailed tables to make exploration easy and insightful.
