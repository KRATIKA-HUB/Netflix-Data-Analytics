### 🚀 Objective

To perform an in-depth analysis of Netflix content and understand:

 1. Distribution of titles by rating groups.


 2. Average ratings across genres and countries.

 3. Viewer engagement through vote counts and averages.

 4. Global content trends using an interactive map visualization.

### 🧩 Problem Statement:

Netflix has a massive global library with diverse genres, ratings, and regional audiences. However, understanding which types of content perform best, what viewers prefer in different regions, and which genres drive engagement can be challenging without structured visualization.

* Detect content performance gaps (low-rated or under-voted categories).

* Compare movies vs. TV shows in terms of audience reception.

* Provide actionable insights for content strategy and regional expansion.

### 🧩 Tools & Technologies:

* Power BI – for visualization and dashboard creation.

* Excel / CSV Dataset – for data cleaning and transformation.

 * DAX & Power Query – for measures and data modeling.
